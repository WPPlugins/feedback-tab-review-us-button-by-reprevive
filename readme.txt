Adds a floating feedback tab / review us button to the side of your site. Link it to a feedback form, review site profile or RenegadeWorks location page.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a floating feedback tab / clickable review us button to the side of your website. See <a href="https://renegadeworks.com/wordpress-plugin-feedback-tab-review-us-button/" target=_blank>our blog post here</a> for screenshots and release notes on this feedback button plugin.

The tab / button / widget stays in the same position as your visitors scroll down the page, but is not intrusive.

It can be linked to:

*   Your RenegadeWorks location page
*   A feedback form
*   A review site profile
*   Anywhere else you wish

The plugin is developed to have a great user experience:

*  No Javascript is used to generate the floating widget, only HTML and CSS
*  The feedback tab button has a hover effect when the cursor is dragged over it to encourage interaction
*  When the widget button is clicked a new browser tab will open to the page you specify. This means the visitor stays on your site in the original tab so you don't lose any traffic.

**Plugin Options**

The plugin is designed to be customizable to your website, but takes less than 1 minute to setup.

Once you have added your Landing Page URL, the plugin will begin working.

You can customize the plugin by choosing from the following options on the settings page:

*   Where you want the floating tab / button / widget to appear. Choose Left or Right.
*   What text you want to use. Choose from: Feedback, Rate Us, Review Us, Contact Us, Support, Apply Now or Sales.
*   Which color theme you want to use. Choose from 7 options.

**Plugin Notes**

A RenegadeWorks account is *not* required is use this plugin. All we ask is that you set the 'Give Credit' option to 'Yes' if you find value using it. This will place a small link at the bottom of the homepage. No other pages are affected.
